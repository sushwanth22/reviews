        <p><strong>My Review:</strong> Samantha starring movie Yashoda starts with a good opening and kept it's best to mantain suspense.<br>
            In some parts of the first half contains lag scenes but with the side characters it maintained it's grip. special<br>
            mentions are sampath,varalaxmi & murali and beside these, others actors also did great. Overall movie is good but ending <br>
            not that satisfactory. I felt that they should have improvised it. But overall you can watch it as timepass movie.</p>
