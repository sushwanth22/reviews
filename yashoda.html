        <p><strong>My Review:</strong> Samantha starring movie Yashoda starts with a good opening and kept it's best to
            mantain suspense.
            In some parts of the first half contains lag scenes but with the side characters it maintained it's grip.
            special
            mentions are sampath,varalaxmi & murali and beside these, others actors also did great. Overall movie is
            good but ending
            not that satisfactory. I felt that they should have improvised it. But overall you can watch it as timepass
            movie.</p>
