        <p><strong>My Review:</strong> Doctor G is a fun movie with emotional touch. Overall the movie is great but somehow you
            feel like they are dragging the movie to make it 2hrs+. I felt like movie completed within 1hr but again they went off
            topic and brought another problem about minor pregnancy. Even with the story flip it maintained its connect via emotions.
            Overall you can watch this movie for those who likes simple movie with fun and emotions.</p>
